# Udacity-ML-Capstone-Kaggle-Allstate

## Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

### Capstone Project

Bryan Luke Lathrop March 6, 2017

This project encapsulates my final project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nano-degree, and is based on the Kaggle competition, [Allstate Claims Severity](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity)

The project is primarily an exercise in various machine learning techniques, with a goal of demonstrating the improvement that can be acheived by their use

It is suggested to start with a brief look at either [JustStacking.ipynb](https://github.com/llathrop/udacity-ML-capstone-Kaggle-Allstate/blob/master/JustStacking.ipynb) or [JustLinear.ipynb](https://github.com/llathrop/udacity-ML-capstone-Kaggle-Allstate/blob/master/JustLinear.ipynb) to get a feel for the code, and then progressing to the project writeup for a full overview of the project.

I should note that input data is not included, but may be downloaded at the competition link. Intermediate cache files are available  to prevent the need to re-run several calculations that may take as much as several days. The data zip includes the original data files as well as my generated data. Download each of: [data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6nundNlo3spWFNKRmZ3YjJUckE)/[cache](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6nundNlo3spNVJsSVRqTnJEQ0U)/[output](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6nundNlo3spMTlwd3hEQ0NQWEk), and unzip to the top level directory of the project.
